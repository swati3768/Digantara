Total Conjunctions on November 10, 2023:

On November 10, 2023, there were a total of [total_conjunctions] conjunctions among active satellites. Descriptive Statistics:

TCA_RANGE Distribution: The TCA_RANGE values on this date exhibit a [describe TCA_RANGE] distribution. This indicates the spatial proximity of satellite conjunctions. TCA_RELATIVE_SPEED Distribution: The TCA_RELATIVE_SPEED statistics suggest a [describe TCA_RELATIVE_SPEED] distribution, providing insights into the relative speeds at conjunctions. MAX_PROB Distribution: The MAX_PROB values follow a [describe MAX_PROB] distribution, indicating the maximum collision probability. Dilution Threshold Analysis:

A dilution threshold of 0.01 was applied to assess the risk associated with conjunctions. [num_high_dilution_conjunctions] conjunctions exceeded this threshold, highlighting potential high-risk events. Recommendations:

Continuous Monitoring:

Continue to monitor space conjunctions regularly to stay informed about potential collision risks. Extend this analysis to different dates to identify patterns and trends over time. Adjust Dilution Threshold:

Consider adjusting the dilution threshold based on the specific requirements and risk tolerance of your space operations. Lower thresholds can help identify higher-risk conjunctions, but they may also trigger more false alarms. Collision Avoidance Strategies:

Develop and implement collision avoidance strategies, especially for conjunctions exceeding the dilution threshold. Utilize the insights from the MAX_PROB and TCA_RELATIVE_SPEED distributions to tailor strategies for minimizing risks. Short-Term Analysis:

Continue to analyze shorter time frames, such as the 5-day period, to gain insights into short-term conjunction dynamics. This analysis can help in managing conjunction risks more effectively. Regular Reporting and Alerts:

Consider automating the analysis process and setting up regular reporting and alerts for conjunction events that exceed predefined thresholds. Timely notifications can help in taking proactive measures to prevent collisions.
